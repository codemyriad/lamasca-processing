Label Studio and Layout Parser can be integrated to iterate and refine lp's output through training.

This package provides tools to
* go from PDFs to images
* refine the images to improve OCR
* generate manifest file that can be imported in Label Studio

And soon it will:
* provide an http server that uses layout parser to do detection/recognition
and can be invoked from within layoutstudio (by connecting a model)
